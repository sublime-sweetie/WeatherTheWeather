# WeatherTheWeather


## Description

As a frequent traveler I like to have an easy way to check the weather. With WeatherTheWeather users can easily check the current weather in any city.


## Installation

Users must have access to the internet and a browser, such as Google Chrome

## Usage

When users arrive at the homepazge, they are greated with a preloaded city and the current weather there. 
Users then enter their zip code or city name and click enter and the page will populate with the weather forcast for there intended city.
